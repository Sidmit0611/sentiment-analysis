      "    stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      \n",

      " a movie like mortal kombat   annihilation works   and must be reviewed on   multiple levels    first   there s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie    but occasionaly   almost as if making an ironic   self depreciating remark   the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery    no no        just kidding    had you going there for a moment   didn t i    in all seriousness however   and to be fair to the movie   it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints   that of a movie watcher unfamiliar   or only marginally familiar   with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon   and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games    the first movie   mortal kombat   1995     concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth   and it s 5 billion inhabitants      the mortals won   and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth    unfortunately   shao khan was a poor loser   and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway   ready to take over the planet   as our heroes assumed a fighting stance    the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those   like myself   who are fans of the game    i d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie    the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself   and they didn t try to overachieve    there were a lot of really cool fight scenes   with really cool accompanying music     intersperesed with some distracting   but ultimately non intrusive   bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot    and   as we know   the movie was a smashing success at the box office    mortal kombat   annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off   with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie    shao khan has decided that he s going to take over the earth * anyways *   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament    thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused   being trite   being silly   and being just plain stupid    one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought   hey   that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now      too bad they didn t simply stick with the formula from the first movie    i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture   but here are the high points     * the acting is truly bad    sandra hess   playing the sonya blade character   is particularly execrable   especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage   a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie       * in one of the worst pieces of mis casting i think i ve * ever * seen   james remar plays raiden   the god of thunder    in the first movie   christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke   a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics    i generally like it when actors are cast against type   tim   tiny   lister   jr   being cast as the president of the u   s   in the fifth element   for example     and remar has always been one of my favorite   utility   actors but he s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn t even have the luxury of amused self awareness     * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important   but then never seen again     * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks   including a muddled scene where liu kang   robin shou   seeks out nightwolf   litefoot     has a mystical hallucination   and then wanders off with jade   irina pantaeva      for these reasons   and many others     i can only give the movie a 2               unless you re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie    in that case   the following critiques also apply     * sandra hess   while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson   who played sonya blade in the first movie     is much more convincing as a fighter    wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer    hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts   and puts together a much more believable fight scene     * in the fights   each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game   and often more      sonya does her   kiss of death     jax does his   earthquake     liu kang does his   animality     and so on    a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely     * there aren t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first   because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between    silly   silly folks    and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud wrestling match    lame and so obviously sexist even i   politically incorrect   for the most part   noticed and remarked upon it     * the special effects are generally better   except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their   animalities      motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie    for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games   i give this a 5    you ll probably like it   but not nearly as much as you liked the first one    \n",

 you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 s plot    my reasoning is simple   i m not sure of any good it would do    the film itself has absolutely no concern with story   only with hurtling forth to the next   special   effect    i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video    nobody will go to this for the plot   and if they do they ll surely regret it    as summer movies evolve   or devolve   character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing    in mi   the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s   that film s director   stylistic flourishes   while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium    it s irrelevant in every sense   as is character    all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors    \n",

      " if you haven t plunked down your hard earned money yet for   wild wild west     the latest summer holiday offering from will smith   let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck s frappacino or on a ben & jerry s sundae    these treats are great relief from the summer heat    in contrast   this film made me simmer in disappointment    i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat    this was true of star wars episode i   but at least in that film   the story and the characters were still in the back seat    in this film   they are no where to be found    what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats   lots of female extras who look like can can dancers   and a clunky   80 foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula    two men are asked to stop this threat    one is artemus gordon   kevin kline     an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents    among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest    the other man is jim west   will smith     who prefers the shoot first then shoot some more method of investigating    although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success   their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate   two man vaudevillian act    for example   there is a scene where west   being more debonair than the reserved gordon   notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat   which is what it is currently filled with       now touch my breast     west says    gordon does so and then softly coos his approval    i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness    the script fails to generate any sense of drama   humor   or fun for that matter    i did enjoy kline s reserved performance   but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith    could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he s not even required to act    it was as if the director was yelling   will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    here s an example    in this scene   will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people    he must endear himself to the crowd to escape    the director yells     will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    in another scene   he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades       will smith   do your own thing       and  action !    worse still   the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess    there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look    there s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film    there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced   but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat    and that s too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his  thing     this film might have been palatable    as it turns out     wild wild west   is the wild   wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year    \n",

      "    stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      \n"
